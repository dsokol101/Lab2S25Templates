In this lab you will replace the C-style array from Lab 1 with vector<string>

It is not necessary to specify the size of a vector, rather just use push_back to add elements at the end of the vector.

You will find that the generic swap is already written in the .h file
thus, you do not have to write a swap, however, you can call it.

 If you want to run my included unit tests, you can type at the shell prompt:
 make test
 
 This command will compile both the files app.cpp and test.cpp
and then run the executable a.out
